# **Custom Form Builder with MERN Stack**

This project is a custom form builder application that allows users to create forms with three unique question types: Categorize, Cloze, and Comprehension. The frontend is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), and Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

## **Features**

- Create and edit custom forms
- Add images to questions and a header image
- Preview forms before saving
- Responses are stored in the MongoDB database with proper schemas
